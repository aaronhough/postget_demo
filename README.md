# postget_demo
Code for producing a demo app build with postget.dev api platform

It's recommended that your api key is stored securely in an environment variable called POSTGET_KEY

If you haven't already done so, check out the source article at https://postget.dev/docs?view=example

Execute the full demo build script by running builder_pipeline.py

The entire application can now be expressed as config as seen in app_as_config.json
